# leaflet-challenge

I used Xpert Learning Assistant and code identified on github to help with this assignment. 

I was able to produce the US map and a test circle (Dallas).

After several hours of researching and trial and error, I could not get my code to produce the earthquake data. I used the console to try to debug and couldn't move past this point.

I feel my code is close and I hope to receive partial credit for this assignment.

To review my work, please open logic.js in the js directory within the static directory within the repo linked. Open the index file using chrome to view my progress.
